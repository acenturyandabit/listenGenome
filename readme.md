# listenGenome

You can listen to the genome of your favourite species of creature / bacteria / virus here!

Allegedly, experienced biologists can detect mutations by listening to the sounds of the bacteria they are studying! 

## How it works
Just like in real life, the individual genes are grouped into 3, to make codons. Each codon contains the following information: the first two letters describe the pitch (out of a 12 note scale); and the last letter determines how long the note should be held.

## How to use
1. Head to [acenturyandabit.github.io/listenGenome].
2. Find a genome by typing a search term (animal, covid, etc) into [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/]
3. Paste the ACTG genome into the textarea. (You can leave the numbers in, the textarea will clean them for you)
4. Press play!

## Todo
- highlight the current codon that is being played
